Title "Proving b is a Unit"

Introduction "
In this level, we prove that under the following conditions b is a unit.
That is, if p is prime, p divides a, and p = a * b, then b must be a unit.
Recall that a number b is a unit if there exists some m and k with m * b = b * k = 1.
"

-- The exercise: prove that if (prime p) ∧ (p ∣ a) ∧ (p = a * b), then b is a unit.
Statement b_unit (p a b : Nat) : (prime p) ∧ (p ∣ a) ∧ (p = a * b) → unit b := by
  Hint "Introduce the hypothesis into your context."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Begin with 'intro h' to bring the whole hypothesis into scope."
  intro h
  Hint "Decompose the hypothesis into its constituent parts."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Apply 'rcases {h} with ⟨p_prime, p_dvd_a, p_eq_ab⟩' to split the conjunction into three separate assumptions."
  rcases h with ⟨p_prime, p_dvd_a, p_eq_ab⟩
  Hint "From the divisibility p ∣ a, extract a witness c such that a = p * c."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Use 'rcases {p_dvd_a} with ⟨c, a_eq_pc⟩' to obtain a natural number c and the equality a = p * c."
  rcases p_dvd_a with ⟨c, a_eq_pc⟩
  Hint "Simplify the definition of unit (which asserts the existence of a multiplicative inverse)."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Unfold the definition with 'dsimp only [unit]'."
  dsimp only [unit]
  Hint "Construct the two required components of the unit definition using the constructor tactic. Use constructor · proof of first statement · proof of second statement"
  constructor
  Hint "Provide the witness {c} for b being a unit."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Write 'exists {c}'."
  exists c
  Hint "Use the substitution property from Level 3 to obtain the proposition p = p * ({c} * b)."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Use the substitution property with: 'have p_eq_pcb : p = p * ({c} * b) := substitution_in_Nat p {c} a b ⟨{a_eq_pc}, {p_eq_ab}⟩'."
  have p_eq_pcb : p = p * (c * b) := substitution_in_Nat p c a b ⟨a_eq_pc, p_eq_ab⟩
  Hint "Apply the cancellation property (from Level 1) to deduce that 1 = {c} * b."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Next, we prove 1 = {c} * b using a 'have' block. Remember that when using 'by', the subsequent proof must be indented."
  have cb_is_one : c * b = 1 := by
    Hint "Within the 'by' block, start by rewriting the left-hand side of the equality. The 'conv' tactic allows you to focus on a specific part of an expression. Use conv at {p_eq_pcb} => ..."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Focus on the left-hand side using 'lhs'."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Rewrite the left-hand side using the identity '← Nat.mul_one p'."
    conv at p_eq_pcb =>
      lhs
      rw [← Nat.mul_one p]
    Hint "After rewriting, apply the cancellation property. This line must be indented further inside the 'by' block."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Use 'exact cancellation_in_Nat ({c} * b) 1 p ⟨Eq.symm {p_eq_pcb}, {p_prime}.not_zero⟩' to finish this part of the proof."
    exact cancellation_in_Nat (c * b) 1 p ⟨Eq.symm p_eq_pcb, p_prime.not_zero⟩
  Hint "Finally, conclude by constructing the unit for b."
  Hint (hidden := true) "Use 'exact {cb_is_one}' to finish this part of the proof"
  exact cb_is_one
--∃ k : Nat, n * k = 1
  Hint "Same start as above: provide the witness {c} for b being a unit."
  exists c
  Hint "Again, use the substitution property from Level 3 to obtain the proposition p = p * ({c} * b)."
  have p_eq_pcb : p = p * (c * b) := substitution_in_Nat p c a b ⟨a_eq_pc, p_eq_ab⟩
  Hint "Now, we need to prove 1 = {c} * b. We can use the same approach as before, but we will need to apply symmetry at the end."
  have one_is_cb : 1 = c * b := by
    Hint "Swap both sides by applying symmetry first."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Use 'apply Eq.symm' to reverse the equality."
    apply Eq.symm
    Hint "Now do the same rewriting as before."
    conv at p_eq_pcb =>
      lhs
      rw [← Nat.mul_one p]
    exact cancellation_in_Nat (c * b) 1 p ⟨Eq.symm p_eq_pcb, p_prime.not_zero⟩

  rw [Nat.mul_comm]
  exact one_is_cb.symm


Conclusion "
Excellent! You have successfully proven that under the given conditions b is a unit.
